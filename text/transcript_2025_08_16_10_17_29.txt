  Andrew Thompson reporting from the Spanish Islands
  of El Hierro, about 400 kilometers
  off the coast of Africa. It's pretty far
  from Madrid which is about 2,000
  Today, we're going to talk
  to two of the 11,000 people who live here.
  To find out what's so special about the island
  first this is Pedro Rodriguez
  Who owns a seafood restaurant on the island?
  Hello, Pedro. Hello, Uncle. So...
  How long have you lived on Elietto?
  I haven't lived here for very long.
  read about five years ago you don't
  Just like it here then? I love it here.
  I had come a lot sooner than I did.
  a lot of my life city life
  can be tough i suppose island
   my honor.
  It's so great about Eliero.
  Everyone hurries everywhere.
  But you never feel like you
  really relax was more
  My career was in banking, which is particularly
  Stressful job.
   and I feel free here.
  City life was never like that.
  When I was living in the city I worked in banking
  as I said, it paid well.
  And I was able to buy my restaurant.
